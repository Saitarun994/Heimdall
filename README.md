## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
- Managed to test Gaussian splatting method and Nvidias Instant NGP
- Recreated 3D models using real world data and large scale google satellite data
- Could recreate realistic 3D maps with a drone in real life, i dont have a drone :(

## What's next for Heimdall
- get funding for a drone and recreate realistic maps in 3D
- Create segment automation script to import map segments into unreal engine automatically
- Test out stable diffusion 3d upscaling
